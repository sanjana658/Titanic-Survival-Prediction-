This project is a machine learning classification project based on the famous Titanic dataset.
The goal is to predict whether a passenger survived or not using passenger information such as class, gender, age, and fare.

The project follows a standard end-to-end ML workflow, including:

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data cleaning and preprocessing

Model training

Evaluation using metrics and visualizations

Interpretation of results

This structure is reusable for any supervised ML classification problem.
Given passenger details from the Titanic disaster, predict:

Survived = 1 → Passenger survived  
Survived = 0 → Passenger did not survive


This is a binary classification problem.
